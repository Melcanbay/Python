# variable?
# While studying the algorithm, we compared variables to boxes. We mentioned that we store information from the user in
# We use variables according to the type of value we will store. So we should understand this from this sentence. Variables have types.
# When defining a variable in other programming languages, we first write the type of the variable, then its name and the value it will hold.
# For example:
# int x = 5
# string user_name = 'Melisa Canbay'
# double pi = 3.14

# Declaring variables in Python
# When defining variables in Python, we do not specify any type as in other programming languages. It automatically takes on the type of value we put into it.

# x=5
# print(type(x)) # here we printed the type of the variable x on the screen with the type () built-in function
# x = 'Melisa Canbay'
# print(type(x))

# Let's get two integers from the user and do 4 basic operations.
# Copies the same line you are on to the line below with CTRL + D
# x = int(input('Enter your value: '))
# y = int(input('Enter your value: '))
# total = x + y
# print(f'Result: {total}')
# subtraction = x - y
# print('Subtraction result: {}'.format(subtraction))
# multiplication = x * y
# print('Result: ', multiply)
# division = x / y
# print(f'Result: {bolme}')

# Develop an application that calculates the area and perimeter of a square based on the edge information received from the user.
x = int(input('Enter edge information: '))
area = x * x
perimeter = 4 * x
print(f'Field: {field}')
print(f'environment: {environment}')

# Write an application that calculates the area and perimeter of the rectangle based on the short and long side information received from the user.
short_edge = int(input('enter short edge: '))
long_side = int(input('enter long side: '))
area = short_edge * long_edge
perimeter = short_side * 2 + long_side * 2
print(f'Area: {area}')
print(f'Perimeter: {perimeter}')

# NOTE!
# Things to consider when defining variables:
# 1. Our variables should not start with numerical expressions.
# 2. It should not contain Turkish characters.
# 3. If our variable name consists of more than one word, we should use the "_" symbol instead of using spaces.

# Let's get the base and height values of the triangle from the user and calculate its area.
base = int(input('enter base information: '))
height = int(input('enter height information: '))
print(f'area: {base * height / 2}')
