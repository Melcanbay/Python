# Try-Except
# These are handle structures where we handle exceptions with Try-Except blocks.
# We write the codes for which we expect errors in the try block. In Exeption, we handle the error we expect.

# For example
# region try-except example
#try:
# divisor = int(input('Division: '))
# divisor = int(input('Division: '))
# x = divided / divided
#print(x)
#except:
# print('An integer cannot be divided by zero')
#else:
# print('If Exception doesn't work, I will run it.') # else cannot be added in other programming languages
#finally:
# print(f'I'll work no matter what.')
# endregion

try:
     age = int(input('Please type your age: '))
     print(age)
except ValueError as err:
     print('Invalid input..!')
