# list
# It is a structure that instantly holds one or more values for us in the application. It can hold different values of more than one type. Since the lists are kept in the RAM, they return to their created state when the application is closed.

# Lists work with index logic. It stores the values stored in the list among index values that increase in positive direction, starting from the zeroth index. In other words, every value held has an index.
